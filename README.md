RNFSample
=========

To compile and run the project, clone https://github.com/vittoriom/RNFPlaceholder first, and grab the RuntimeNetworkFoundation/RuntimeNetworkFoundation folder (that's the main framework folder).
In the future there will be pods for all the stuff, but it's just the first viable product, so everything's a little bit rough.

Run <code>pod install</code>, open the workspace, update the reference to the RuntimeNetworkFoundation folder.

Now it should build and run. You can play with the plist and see how everything works :)
